<p>My name is Adams Rosales. I have worked with data as an analyst, data scientist, and now a data engineer since 2014. I've worked in a range of different industries and companies including J.P. Morgan, Criteo, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. I currently work as a senior data engineer for an identity protection and cybersecurity startup called Aura.</p>
<p>I got into data engineering because it's a great blend of analytics and engineering. I enjoy the aspect of solving complex technical problems with engineering solutions but also unlocking business value from data by empowering analytics and reporting. My path to data engineering certainly wasn't planned. I stumbled into the role simply by following my passions for data and technology. Because of this non-traditional background and experience at many different companies, I feel that I have a unique perspective into what it takes to become and be successful as a data engineer.</p>
<p>I am very passionate about self-learning and remote, distributed work. Thanks to my role as a remote data engineer, I was able to move to the Raleigh, NC area this year from Seattle, WA and be closer to my family while working a job I'm passionate about. One of the goals of this blog is to empower others to build in-demand data skills to help them land a similar position.</p>
<p>In my spare time I enjoy traveling, travel and nature photography, listening to music, and spending time with my two dogs, Pepper and Daisy.</p>
