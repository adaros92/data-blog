        <div class="section" id="my-experience">
<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>FAANG stands for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet. These companies are often seen as the holy grail
of achievement among engineering graduates. The top of top for career opportunities and compensation. New graduates flock
to these companies looking to be challenged, build cutting edge products, and add the prestigious brand names to their
resumes. But are roles in these companies really as great as they sound?</p>
<p>I've worked at Amazon in the Seattle area for about 3-4 years, rotating between 4 different teams at the company and
leaving to work at a start up only to return 7 months later. I've also had the opportunity to work in different industries
including banking, ad-tech, and manufacturing in both small companies and large corporations and I've interviewed at other
FAANG companies like Facebook. I will share with you what I've observed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="internal-tools-galore">
<h2>Internal Tools Galore</h2>
<p>My biggest pet peeve about my job is the amount of internal tools I have to deal with on a daily basis. These tools
are supposed to make our lives easier and streamline the development process but from my experience they abstract away
crucial details about the underlying services that engineers should know. Sometimes these services may be industry
standard like AWS, Kubernetes, continuous deployment tools, etc. but because you have the internal applications sitting
on top of these services and only a shitty proprietary UI is exposed to you, in the end you don't really learn how to work
with AWS, Kubernetes, or anything else. You learn to work with the internal tools. You can't really put that on your
resume when applying to bigger and better opportunities down the line and most importantly, it robs you from the opportunity
to learn valuable skills on the job.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rampant-bureaucracy">
<h2>Rampant Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>There is a lot of corporate red tape at FAANG companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="easy-to-get-stuck-in-ops-hell">
<h2>Easy to Get Stuck in Ops Hell</h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="too-much-focus-on-levels-and-promotions">
<h2>Too Much Focus on Levels and Promotions</h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen">
<h2>Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen</h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projects-lacking-in-scope">
<h2>Projects Lacking in Scope</h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-it-worth-it">
<h2>Is It Worth It?</h2>
<p>I am grateful for the opportunities that I've had and wouldn't do anything different if given the chance to do it all
over again. So, yes I do think it's worth it and I recommend these companies to any new grad looking to gain valuable
real world experience and make good money while doing so. However, I do not recommend getting stuck in dead-end roles
or forgoing opportunities to learn just because you've made it to FAANG.</p>
<p>While start ups or lesser known companies may not offer the same level of compensation as FAANG, you may end up learning
a lot more in a shorter amount of time, which will ultimately lead to better opportunities and more compensation down
the line. This is because younger and/or smaller companies may not suffer from the same issues that plague larger more
established corporations like FAANG. No matter what the recruiters or kool-aid drinkers at these companies say, the truth
is that they face the same issues that exist in other non-tech bloated corporations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="there-is-no-substitute-for-self-learning">
<h2>There Is No Substitute for Self-Learning</h2>
<p>In my opinion the most important thing an engineer could do in their early career is learn as much as possible. While
I think that younger companies offer better opportunities to learn than FAANG, ultimately no company will provide you
with the same growth as self-learning will. When you take the initiative to learn new things as a result of your own
passion and curiosity you can learn a lot more in a shorter amount of time than you can at work. This is because you won't
be hindered by formal procedures, company priorities, operational load, your title or level, etc.</p>
