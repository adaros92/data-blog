My Experience
#############
FAANG stands for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet. These companies are often seen as the holy grail
of achievement among engineering graduates. The top of top for career opportunities and compensation. New graduates flock
to these companies looking to be challenged, build cutting edge products, and add the prestigious brand names to their
resumes. But are roles in these companies really as great as they sound?

I've worked at these types of companies in the Seattle area for about 3-4 years, rotating between 4 different teams and
leaving to work at a start up only to return 7 months later. I've also had the opportunity to work in different industries
including banking, ad-tech, and manufacturing in both small companies and large corporations. I will share with you what
I've observed.

Internal Tools Galore
#####################
My biggest pet peeve about my job is the amount of internal tools I have to deal with on a daily basis. These tools
are supposed to make our lives easier and streamline the development process but from my experience they abstract away
crucial details about the underlying services that engineers should know. Sometimes these services may be industry
standard like AWS, Kubernetes, continuous deployment tools, etc. but because you have the internal applications sitting
on top of these services and only a shitty proprietary UI is exposed to you, in the end you don't really learn how to work
with AWS, Kubernetes, or anything else. You learn to work with the internal tools. You can't really put that on your
resume when applying to bigger and better opportunities down the line and most importantly, it robs you from the opportunity
to learn valuable skills on the job.

Rampant Bureaucracy
###################
There is a lot of corporate red tape at FAANG companies. Teams like to build walls around their work and decisions are
made at a very slow pace. Often any meaningful change involves dealing with strong personalities and defensive leaders of different
teams. That may be interesting to you if you enjoy the challenge of dealing with different types of people and working
through the bullshit to drive change or whatever. However, if you just want to work on interesting projects as an engineer,
often times the bureaucracy can be a real pain. It means unnecessary meetings, ego-stroking, way too much planning without
any execution, the necessity to constantly update others on your progress, product managers over-promising on your behalf
to impress the leaders, etc. Worst of all it can also mean that sometimes you just can't touch what you really want to
gain more exposure to because some other team owns it. Whether it's getting access to some code or contributing to a certain
pipeline, the red tape can make it so difficult to do anything beyond your immediate job responsibilities that it can
seriously hamper your growth as an engineer.

Easy to Get Stuck in Ops Hell
#############################
I've been in teams that very rarely write any new code or release incremental features. All they do is hit buttons on some
UI to restart failed jobs, copy existing jobs to run in new regions, dig into tickets regarding those jobs, and answer
e-mails about the jobs. Essentially just maintaining the same old pipelines that may add a lot of value to the company but
are just plain boring to work with. Months go by and you realize you've been doing the same ops work over and over without
learning anything. This isn't even unique to data engineering, which tends to be more ops-heavy at large companies. I've
even been in software engineering teams that do the same thing.

This is surprisingly common given how many things have been built at these companies. Rarely do you get to be in a team
that's truly pushing the boundary and working in a completely greenfield environment. In other words, those truly
innovative teams that everyone thinks they'll be a part of if they join a prestigious tech company are more of an
exception than the norm. It's great if you can be a part of those teams, but it's unlikely that you will be from the start.

An Unhealthy Focus on Job Levels
################################
I don't know if it's selection bias with the types of candidates that FAANG attracts but there is a questionable obsession
with levels, titles and total compensation at these companies. If you don't believe me, spend a few minutes reading
through FAANG posts on https://www.teamblind.com/. Sometimes it feels like that's all people care about. I have definitely
felt that sometimes people prioritize the projects that will get them noticed by some leaders with fancy titles over anything
else, even if those projects will not help them learn anything, grow in any other way, or add the most value in the long run.
I've even had managers insinuate that the work their reports are doing is not as important as pleasing some director or VP,
even if that work is pushing buttons on some UI and you have 4 talented software engineers wasting their time hitting those buttons.

My first job out of college was in banking where brown-nosing and kissing your superior's ass is the norm. People make
entire careers out of that alone. It's one of the reasons why I left that industry. I felt like it didn't matter what I knew
as long as I impressed the right people one way or another. I thought that big tech would be different and to some extent
it is, but there is still a lot of that unhealthy obsession with pleasing authority figures at all costs.

Projects Lacking in Scope
#########################
Most of the cool data engineering stuff you learn about in school or in your spare time outside of work has already
been done at FAANG companies. They pioneered the application of that fancy machine learning algorithm or way to process
data. Odds are that you will not be working on any of that because it simply has already been done. What does need to get done
is system maintenance and super downstream work of slicing and dicing some datasets that have already been curated by
a different team long ago. It's common to come across long chains of teams doing work that's frankly not that interesting
from a technical perspective. You depend on that work from a different team and some other team depends on your small piece
of the puzzle to inform their business decisions. There is a lot of simple SQL writing and very little system design work.

If you care more about the business or doing your job well and getting promoted, then that type of work can be great.
However, if you're looking for a technical challenge after learning all about the latest in streaming data, artificial intelligence,
data modeling, or some other hot topic, you may be disappointed in the types of projects you actually end up working on.

Is It Worth It?
###############
I am grateful for the opportunities that I've had and wouldn't do anything different if given the chance to do it all
over again. So, yes I do think it's worth it and I recommend these companies to any new grad looking to gain valuable
real world experience and make good money while doing so. However, I do not recommend getting stuck in dead-end roles
or forgoing opportunities to learn just because you've made it to FAANG. Don't be afraid to job hop and search for roles
that will make you a better engineer in the long run, even if you have to take a pay cut.

While start ups or lesser known companies may not offer the same level of compensation as FAANG, you may end up learning
a lot more in a shorter amount of time, which will ultimately lead to better opportunities and more compensation down
the line. This is because younger and/or smaller companies may not suffer from the same issues that plague larger more
established corporations like FAANG. No matter what the recruiters or Kool-Aid drinkers at these companies say, the truth
is that they face the same issues that exist in other non-tech bloated corporations.

So to summarize, don't chase the brand name. Look for the roles that will teach you the most and give you plenty of
opportunity to build new things. Also, do your due diligence before accepting a role. Talk to members of the team and
ask them what they do every day and if they enjoy their jobs. Pretty much all of them will say they do because they're
trying to get you to join but you can often times read between the lines and deduce from their daily tasks what
the job will be like.

There Is No Substitute for Self-Learning
########################################
In my opinion the most important thing an engineer could do in their early career is learn as much as possible. While
I think that younger companies offer better opportunities to learn than FAANG, ultimately no company will provide you
with the same growth as self-learning will. When you take the initiative to learn new things as a result of your own
passion and curiosity you can learn a lot more in a shorter amount of time than you can at work. This is because you won't
be hindered by formal procedures, company priorities, operational load, or your official title.
